       <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>Outside of my work I am a very laid back individual who is interested in a wide range of activities including cooking, playing video games, and target shooting. I come from a small family of just my mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, and myself and we are all very close to one another. A personal habit of mine is that I like collecting. My two favorite things to collect include gems, fossils, and crystals, as well as firearms. Lastly, I love animals! As a matter of fact, my family owns 6 cats that we love very much.</p>
