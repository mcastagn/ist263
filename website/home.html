            <div id=aip><h2>What Is Aging-In-Place?</h2>
                <p>
                Aging in place is when an individual decides to stay in their home and community safely, independently, and functionally regardless of age, income, or ability level by adapting their home to fit their specific needs, with the help of external assistance if necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>Reasons to Age-in-Place</h2>
            <ul class="reasons">
                <li><Strong>Cost Efficiency:</Strong> Assisted living and nursing homes get expensive very fast, considering most insurance plans and Medicare don’t offer support for long-term care. If your home can be adapted so that you can safely and independently function as your needs change, it can save you money in the long run. This is especially true if your home is already paid off.<br>
                </li>
                <p></p><br>
                <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Eventually, all individuals will need help completing tasks to some extent as they age. However, if you aim to maintain your independence longer, this can be done through an aging-in-place plan. This endeavor becomes even easier if there are family, friends, or hired assistance, such as a home health aide available to help. Not only is staying independent important for some individuals to stay satisfied with their lives, it also helps keep the mind and body healthy.<br>
                </li>
                <p></p><br>
                <li><strong>Familiar Setting and Routine:</strong> Keeping a regular routine and familiar setting as we grow old is very important to a lot of individuals. In most cases, there is sentimental value attached to an individual’s home and way of life. Aging-in-place is a great way to keep the things that make us happy around us as we age. While some individuals are okay with the changes in lifestyle as they move to an assisted living community or nursing home, others struggle with it.<br>

<h2>Reasons not to Age-in-Place</h2>
    <ul class="reasons">
        <li><strong>Safety Concerns:</strong> Aging-in-place does not come without its downsides. Although it can be a practical and fulfilling way of life with the right support system, without that support system one may face safety risks. If you plan to live by yourself with little to no access to capable outside help from friends, family, or hired assistance you risk your safety through physical or cognitive impairment. If an individual was to forget to take their medication or finds themselves in a situation that they cannot get out of without help, it could be detrimental to their health.<br>
        </li>
        <p></p><br>
        <li><strong>Home Maintenance:</strong> As we grow older, so do our homes. It’s important that we take this into account before deciding to age-in-place. Some individuals may not be physically capable to complete home repairs on their own, or struggle to fund reliable help to do so. With that said, it is important that home maintenance is kept on top of since neglecting it could result in safety risks.<br>
        </li>
    </ul>
